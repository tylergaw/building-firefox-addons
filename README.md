# Building Firefox Add-ons

Building Firefox Add-ons is a infinitely frustrating experience. There doesn't
appear to be any central location for documentation and most info you find seems
to be hopelessly out of date.

This repo is an attempt to gather information and examples of Firefox Add-on
development and best practices.

## "Official" Documentation

I'm quoting that because it's hard to tell what docs are current. Or if you're
even looking at the right thing.

### Maybe good

- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/developers/builder
- https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/dev-guide/tutorials/index.html


### Most likely deprecated and/or who the fuck knows

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Toolkit_API/FUEL
- https://wiki.mozilla.org/Jetpack

## Github repos

The best way to learn is sometimes to just see how someone else did it.
